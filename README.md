#Project analysis:

## The final user
**o** The final user, who will access to see the information on my CV, will mainly be companies interested in my experiences and/or skills that I have, to be able to work with them or recommend me to other jobs.
When they go to see my resume they expect to see the clear and concise information they want, without a lot of text or the page very full of unnecessary objects, a clear and clean design.
The information they expect must also be short and clear, to be able to analyze it quickly.

## Information architecture
**o** Being a CV, the information must be clear and concise, it could be done on more than one page and in different sections, but this would make it difficult to be clear at first glance and, therefore, a bad approach.

## Visual design
**o** Personally, I have based a lot on the design I made of my previous curriculum, I considered that considering a "serious" page, to exceed colors on the page would cause a bad impression and bad design.
The colors I have used cause a feeling of seriousness, it varies between navy blue, gray and white, (black for the text), the text that is in the navy blue section, I considered doing it in one more color grays, since if I used white, the contrast would have been too strong for the eye.
Furthermore, the less important elements or sub-elements, I have put them in a gray color, to indicate that they have a different importance.
The same goes for the most important elements, which are put in bold, so that the user's eyes go directly there.
The typography, is Bradesco Sans it is designed so that visually it is a serious source, but also without going overboard and creating a feeling of confidence. We must think that typography is very important, as it has a meaning, and communicate how we want to express ourselves.

In conclusion, the result has been as expected, all the elements are ordered, a correct palette and font to express the appropriate seriousness.

I must emphasize that thanks to this work I have been able to learn a lot more about HTML and CSS, languages that I would be interested in focusing on more.
